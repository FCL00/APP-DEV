# CSS Overflow
The CSS overflow property offers powerful solutions for handling content that exceeds its container's dimensions,
ensuring optimal presentation and usability. Let's delve into the intricacies of the overflow property, 
exploring its functionality, practical applications, and best practices in web development.

## Understanding CSS Overflow
The overflow property in CSS controls how content that overflows its container is handled.
It specifies whether to display scrollbars, clip the content, or automatically expand 
the container to accommodate the overflow.

```
.container {
  overflow: auto;
}
```
In this example, the `overflow: auto;` rule enables scrollbars to appear automatically when the content exceeds the container's dimensions.

## Handling Overflow Scenarios
- overflow: visible: Content that overflows the container's boundaries is fully visible, potentially overlapping other elements on the page.
```
.container{
  overflow: visible;
}
```
- overflow: hidden: Content that exceeds the container's dimensions is clipped and not visible.
```
.container{
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
- overflow: scroll: Scrollbars are always visible, allowing users to scroll through the content vertically and/or horizontally.
```
.container{
  overflow: scroll;
}
```
- overflow: auto: Scrollbars appear only when the content overflows the container, providing a seamless user experience.
```
.container{
   overflow: auto;
}
```
- overflow-x: represents the horizontal scrollbar.
```
.container{
   overflow-x: auto;

  <!-- disable the horizontal scrolling -->
  <!-- overflow-x: hidden; -->
}
```
- overflow-y: represents the vertical scrollbar.
```
container{
   overflow-y: auto;

  <!-- disable the vertical scrolling -->
  <!-- overflow-y: hidden; -->
}
```

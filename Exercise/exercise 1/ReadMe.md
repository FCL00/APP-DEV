# Exercise: Grade Checker
Create a program that checks a student's grade based on their exam score.
Use if-else statements to determine the grade.
The grading scale is as follows:
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: Below 60

```
  // This is a sample syntax 
  let examScore = 0; // change the value
  
  if (examScore) {
    // your code goes here
  } else {
    // your code goes here
  }
```

# Text Formatting in HTML

HTML offers a range of elements and attributes that enable developers to manipulate the appearance and style of text content. From emphasizing key points to structuring content for improved comprehension, HTML text formatting plays a vital role in shaping user experiences.

## Common Text Formatting Elements in HTML

- Bold Text (`<b>`): The `<b>` element is used to apply bold formatting to text, indicating stronger emphasis without implying any specific semantic meaning.
- Italic Text (`<i>`): The `<i>` element is used to apply italic formatting to text, typically used for emphasizing words or phrases without altering the overall meaning.
- Strong Text (`<strong>`): The `<strong>` element is used to indicate strong importance or emphasis, often rendered as bold text by default, but with added semantic significance.
- Emphasized Text (`<em>`): The `<em>` element is used to emphasize text, typically rendered as italicized text by default, with added semantic significance compared to `<i>`.
- Underline Text (`<u>`): The `<u>` element is used to underline text, although its usage is discouraged for semantic reasons, as underlining is commonly associated with hyperlinks.
- `<del>`: The `<del>` element is used to indicate deleted or removed text. Browsers often render `<del>` text with a strikethrough style by default.
- `<big>`: The `<big>` element is used to increase the size of text. However, it's considered obsolete and is not recommended for use in modern web development.
- `<small>`: Conversely, the `<small>` element decreases the size of text. It's often used for disclaimers, copyright notices, or fine print.
- `<sub>`: The `<sub>` element is used to render text as subscript, typically for mathematical expressions, chemical formulas, or footnotes.
- `<sup>`: Conversely, the `<sup>` element is used to render text as superscript, often for exponents, ordinal numbers, or citations.
- `<tt>`: The `<tt>` element is used to render text in a monospaced or "typewriter" font, often used for displaying code snippets or computer output.
- `<mark>`: The `<mark>` element is used to highlight or mark portions of text. Browsers typically render <mark> text with a background color, making it stand out from surrounding content.

## Applying Text Formatting with CSS
While HTML provides basic text formatting options, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) offers additional flexibility and control over text appearance. Developers can leverage CSS properties to customize font styles, sizes, colors, and more.

# Images
HTML images play a pivotal role in enhancing the visual appeal and communicative power of web pages. Whether it's showcasing products in an e-commerce store, illustrating concepts in educational materials, or adding personality to blog posts, images serve as dynamic elements that engage and captivate audiences.


## Syntax HTML image
HTML images are inserted using the `<img>` (image) element, which specifies the location and attributes of the image to be displayed. The basic syntax of an HTML image consists of the `<img>` tag, the src attribute specifying the image file's URL, and optional attributes such as alt text, width, height, and more.

```
<!-- set the source image locally -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="300" height="200">

<!-- you can source the image that is available online -->
<img src="www.source.com" alt="Description of the image" width="300" height="200">
```

## Attributes of HTML Images
HTML images support several attributes that govern their behavior, appearance, and accessibility:

- `src`: Specifies the URL of the image file to be displayed.
- `alt`: Provides alternative text for the image.
- `width`: Sets the width of the image in pixels or as a percentage of the container.
- `height`: Sets the height of the image in pixels or as a percentage of the container.
- `title`: Provides additional information about the image, typically displayed as a tooltip when hovering over the image.

# HTML Video

HTML video elements provide developers with the means to embed video content directly within web pages, offering users a rich and immersive viewing experience. Whether it's educational tutorials, promotional videos, or cinematic trailers, HTML video elements enable developers to deliver dynamic and engaging content that captivates audiences and leaves a lasting impression.

## Syntax of HTML Video Elements

HTML video elements are represented by the `<video>` tag, which encapsulates video content and provides controls for playback and interaction. The basic syntax of an HTML video element consists of the opening `<video>` tag, the source (`<source>`) elements specifying the video file's location and format, and the closing `</video>` tag.
```
<video controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

## Attributes of HTML Video Elements

HTML video elements support various attributes that govern their behavior and presentation:

- `src`: Specifies the URL of the video file to be played.
- `controls`: Enables the default video controls, allowing users to play, pause, adjust volume, and seek within the video.
- `autoplay`: Automatically starts playback of the video when the page loads.
- `loop`: Causes the video to repeat continuously once playback reaches the end.

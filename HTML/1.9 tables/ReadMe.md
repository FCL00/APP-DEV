# Tables

Tables in HTML are indispensable tools for organizing and displaying data in a structured format. Let's dive into the world of HTML tables, exploring their elements and attributes to craft visually appealing and informative data presentations.

# Understanding the Structure:

`<table>`: Defines the table.
`<caption>`: Provides a title or description for the table.
`<thead>`: Defines the table header.
`<tr>`: Represents a row within the table.
`<th>`: Represents a header cell within a row.
`<tbody>`: Contains the main content of the table.
`<td>`: Represents a data cell within a row.

Tables in HTML are used to display data in rows and columns. Below is an example demonstrating the usage of the `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements to create a simple table:

```
<table>
  <caption>Monthly Sales Report</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Revenue</th>
      <th>Expenses</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>January</td>
      <td>$10,000</td>
      <td>$6,000</td>
      <td>$4,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>February</td>
      <td>$12,000</td>
      <td>$7,000</td>
      <td>$5,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>March</td>
      <td>$15,000</td>
      <td>$8,000</td>
      <td>$7,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
